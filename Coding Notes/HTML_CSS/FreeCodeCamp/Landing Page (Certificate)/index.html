                                    your eyes, hands, and voice — interactions feel intuitive and magical. Simply look at an element, tap your fingers together to

                                <li>In visionOS, apps can fill the space around you, beyond the boundaries of a display. They can be moved anywhere, scaled to the

                                    any controllers, so you can accurately select elements just by looking at them.

                                <li><strong>A sophisticated sensor array. </strong>A pair of high-resolution cameras transmit over one billion pixels per second to
                                    the displays so you can see the world around you clearly. The system also helps deliver precise head and hand tracking and 
                                    real‑time 3D mapping, all while understanding your hand gestures from a wide range of positions.

                                    graphics, all with incredible efficiency. And the brand-new R1 chip is specifically dedicated to process input from the cameras,
                                    sensors, and microphones, streaming images to the displays within 12 milliseconds — for a virtually lag-free, real-time view of
